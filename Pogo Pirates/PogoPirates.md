*Worked as Gameplay Programmer*

14th November 2024 to 3rd January 2025.


I loved working with this game. It taught me a lot about programming design patterns, when to make critical decisions and my ability to work in a team.


## Gameplay

During the creation of Pogo Pirates, I worked with:

* The join lobby screen
* The core gameloop
* Character movement and actions

Among these I developed or used:

* Singletons and do not destroy in Unity
* Unity's new input system to develop a local multiplayer game
* State machines
* Observer patterns


## Teamwork

Our team used scrum to create a good flow. We used weekly sprints and set up goals to be completed and helped each other out whenever needed.
